Files included are:
* Scripts to merge the raw data and training data sets into one tidy data set
* A script to compute and output statiistics on the tidy data set
* A codebook that describes the variables in the data set

The variables: meanFreq(), gravityMean, tBodyAccMean, tBodyAccJerkMean, tBodyGyroMean and tBodyGyroJerkMean were not included becuase they do not have corresponding standard deviation values.
